Project 4: Text Compression

The original text has 198283 characters.
The average length of a code is 4.51 bits.
The text is encoded in 893832 bits.
The savings is 692432 bits.
The compressed text is encoded in 111730 characters.
The savings is 86553 characters.
Decompressing yields 893832 bits.
The recovered text has 198283 characters.

All tests passed...

% of bits saved = 692432/(692432+893832)=43.65%
