1. Design Decision:
I decided to use a primitive 2-d java array for keeping my hash table. I made this decision as using Primitive data types 
require less overhead than creating a objects representing key/value pairs.

2. lookup: This function was created to find the position for a key for get, put and increment function.

hash: To find hash value for a key.

findNewSize: To search for a new valid array size during rehashing.

3. Davinci image: 42831
VanGogh : 42127

4. vangogh and degas are the most similar.
Number of collisions with Linear strategy: 9163888
Number of collisions with Quadratic strategy: 3143467

5. I have never coded in java. So learning java itself was new for me. Apart from this, I encountered an unexpected timing issue. 
This was due to size of the array being counted by looping over the array and finding the count of occupied positions.
I changed this to keep a variable which gets incremented when a new element gets added.
