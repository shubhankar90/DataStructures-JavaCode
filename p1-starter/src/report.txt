1. Design Decision:
I decided to use a primitive 2-d java array for keeping my hash table. I made this decision as using Primitive data types 
require less overhead than creating a objects representing key/value pairs.

2. lookup: This function was created to find the position for a key for get, put and increment function.

hash: To find hash value for a key.

findNewSize: To search for a new valid array size during rehashing.
